# todo:

* TODO: Give a final pass to the roles documentation (I added some things since writing those).
* TODO: Install extra tools on the servers.
* TODO: HA's haresources would'nt detect downed services and autoswitch. Migrate to Pacemaker.
* TEST: When bringing up the nfs servers from sleep and are already provisioned, they reach a stalemate.
* TODO: WEB: Make the Tests for the web servers. And test them.
* TODO: Register the exits of the tests and output them (both NFS and WEB servers)
* TODO: HA: make a script that tests status of the HA service on the host quickly without that much typing.
* TODO: Docker probably will be running as root...? This should be changed for prod.
* TODO: Performance on web servers. Change volume for to a bind mount as per https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/
* TODO: NFS Test play must delete the directory before populating or running tests.
* TODO: NFS Fill play too must delete the contents of the directory.
* TODO: It'be nice to check beforehand too.
* TODO: Add the ansible-galaxy install command to the localdownload Play.
* TODO: DOC: resources are mostly mounted up by HA.
* TODO: Delete tests directories from roles if are not going to be used.
* TODO: Study the (nice!) make and Makefile structure of the ansible-softwareraid role.
* TODO: Vagrant: web servers: Add a production network.
* WONT FIX: ~~TODO: VAGRANT: NFS change NIC type.~~ [Not a problem](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10481#issuecomment-445074331).
* WONT FIX: ~~TODO: If NFS HA keeps failing, check for a quorum device in host for guests to share with.~~ (Unless Pacemaker requires it)
* DONE: ~~WEB docker monitor for HA: It will be nice to actually take care of the service also~~. Made **dockermon**
* DONE: ~~NFS: use the goss module to perform the tests.~~
* DONE: ~~INVESTIGATE AND TEST: should the installation of the HA service go last? All tests seem to point that way.~~ Playbooks updated.
* DONE: ~~ADD: service name and IP to /etc/hosts file on both services to easier check if online.~~
* DONE: ~~Add goss /testing role and tests.~~
* DONE: ~~service heartbeat enable y start~~
* NOT NEEDED ANY MORE. ~~Make a stalemate breaker playbook (fixed the playbook)~~

+ Mem for VM (hopefully to host the entire disk on RAM)
+ disks. Won't test, not much sense since everything is in the same disk.
